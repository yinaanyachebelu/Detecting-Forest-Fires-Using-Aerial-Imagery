# Detecting-Forest-Fires-Using-Aerial-Imagery
Final Project: Machine Learning for Remote Sensing

The goal of this project is to classify aerial imagery of forests based on if they depict a fire or not using machine learning and deep learning. 
The data comes from “The FLAME Dataset: Aerial Imagery Pile Burn Detection Using Drones (UAVS)” from the IEEE Data portal.

Part 1 of the project involves an attempt to build an autoencoder to be used for dimensionality
reduction given the research demonstrating that autoencoders can have smaller errors than Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Hinton et. al, 2006). 
Part 2 includes an attempt to use the encoded images to fit the best Support Vector Machine (SVM) model indicated by a grid search. 
Part 3 of the project involves creating and testing a custom convolutional neural network (CNN).
